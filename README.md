# GooglePhotosTakeoutDateFix

Google Photos takeout screws up the date created and date modified of the files exported with it.  This script uses the json of metadata that google exports with the pictures to recreate the modification date in Windows only.  It'll need to be adjusted to work with linux or mac if desired.  And it'll only fix the modified date.
